## general info

The lab is being established at Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciencess Prague. 

## scientific approach

Our lab will have a flat hierarchical structure with uninimous decession, and genuin non-violent communicatiton. The scientific rigour is what matters to us.

## teaching and mentoring approach

**Student oriented course design** - We start by asking the students what and how they want to learn and fluidly design/change the course according to students needs.
