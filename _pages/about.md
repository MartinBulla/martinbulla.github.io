I strive to understand the World within and around me. Using birds, mainly shorebirds, as a study system, I explore 
- <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41223-z'>rhythms of parental care</a> and <a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00093'>how such rhythms emerge</a>, 
-  <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20563'>within- and between-species differences in rhythmicities</a> and what may drive such differences, as well as
- <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13662'>distribution and evolution of traits across the globe</a>
